##Testing
Test 1 - All links were tested both through the routing buttons and directly typing the URL => Outputs were as expected

Test 2 - 404 page - the 404 page was tested by entering incorrect URLs => (http://localhost:3000/test) was used as an example URL => Outputs returned as expected

Test 3 - Mailto - Mailto was tested by completing the contact form and testing to see if it was correctly launched and formatted => "Job offer" was the sample subject and Lorem Ipsum was used as the content => results returned as expected

Test 4 - Blank mailto - " " empty strings were used to bypass the required tag on the form inputs => Form still behaved as expected and generated an email with blank subject and blank conent => Outputs functioned as expected
